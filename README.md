Title: Simon: Will you follow me?

Description: 
Simon: Will you follow me? is a spin off of the classic game Simon. There will be a game board composed of four, uniquely colored squares. The squares will flash in a sequence, with an additional color added each turn. The sequence will be random and unique to each game. The player will repeat the sequence after each presentation, continuing until they make a mistake. The players score and high score will be displayed and an instruction guide will be offered.
